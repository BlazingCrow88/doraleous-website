# ===================================
# .NOJEKYLL FILE
# File: .nojekyll
# ===================================

# This empty file tells GitHub Pages not to process the site with Jekyll
# This is important for sites that:
# - Use their own build process
# - Have files/folders starting with underscores
# - Want to bypass Jekyll processing entirely

# Just having this file present (even empty) disables Jekyll processing
