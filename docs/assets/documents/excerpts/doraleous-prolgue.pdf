Prologue  
The Unsealing 
Deep beneath the mountain's stone, 
Ancient seals lay carved in bone, 
Warnings etched in scripts of old, 
Stories that should not be told. 
Seven locks of power bound 
What was meant to stay unfound, 
Yet greed calls louder than fear, 
As mortal hearts refuse to hear. 
The darkness stirs beneath the earth, 
Awaiting its unholy birth, 
When folly breaks what wisdom sealed, 
And ancient hunger is revealed.

Thunder crashed across the Shadowdepth Mountains 
as Master Miner Gorak descended deeper into the earth than 
any living man had ventured before. The storm above sent 
tremors through the ancient stone, causing his torch to flicker 
with each rolling peal that echoed through the tunnels. Behind 
him, eleven miners followed in nervous silence, their picks and 
shovels clanging against the carved walls as they navigated 
passages that grew increasingly unnatural with each step. 
"These ain't natural formations, Master Gorak," mut
tered Hendric, the eldest of the crew, running his weathered 
f
 ingers along symbols carved into the tunnel wall. The mark
ings were deep and precise, cut with tools that left edges 
sharper than any iron chisel could achieve. "Look at these 
signs—they're deliberate, like someone was trying to tell us 
something." 
Gorak raised his torch higher, illuminating intricate carv
ings that spiraled along the ceiling in patterns that made his 
2 
eyes water to follow. The symbols bore no resemblance to any 
script he knew, yet something about their angular geometry 
suggested warning, prohibition, danger. His gut clenched with 
unease, but the memory of the mine owners' expectations—
 and the promise of silver rich enough to feed his family through 
the coming winter—drove him forward. 
"The vein runs deep," he said, his voice echoing 
strangely in the confined space. "The surface deposits were 
just the beginning. Whatever built these tunnels, they knew 
where the real treasure lay." 
Lightning struck directly overhead, and in that brilliant 
instant, the carved warnings seemed to writhe and shift in the 
dancing torchlight. Young Berin, barely sixteen and on his first 
deep excavation, pressed closer to the group as unnatural 
shadows flickered between the ancient symbols. 
The passage opened into a vast chamber that swal
lowed their torchlight before revealing its true dimensions. Go
rak's breath caught in his throat as he stepped into the space, 
3 
his footsteps echoing with the hollow sound of vastness. The 
chamber was perfectly circular, carved from black stone that 
seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. Along the walls, 
murals depicted battles between beings of radiant light and 
creatures of living shadow, their conflict frozen in stone relief 
that spoke of ancient conflicts beyond mortal understanding. 
But it was the far wall that drew every eye and stilled 
every tongue. 
A massive stone door dominated the chamber's north
ern end, its surface covered in seven distinct sealing mecha
nisms. Each lock bore the craftsmanship of a different people: 
the geometric precision of dwarven metalwork, the flowing 
curves of elven script, the solid practicality of human engineer
ing, and four others worked in styles that belonged to no living 
civilization. The seals were integrated into the door's structure 
so seamlessly that they appeared to have been created by the 
same hand, despite their wildly different origins.

"By the deep fires," whispered Korven, the crew's dwarf 
engineer, stepping closer to examine the locks. "These bind
ings... they're not just keeping something out. They're keeping 
something in." 
Gorak felt the weight of decision pressing down upon 
him like the mountain itself. Every instinct developed through 
twenty years of mining screamed danger, but the gleam of sil
ver veins visible beyond the door's crystal viewing ports over
whelmed his caution. The mine owners had invested every
thing in this excavation. Failure would mean not just his posi
tion, but the livelihood of every family in the settlement above. 
"We've come this far," he said, his voice carrying forced 
confidence. "Those seals are ancient. Whatever they were built 
to contain is long dead. That silver could change everything for 
our people." 
The work began with Korven's careful examination of the 
dwarven lock, its mechanisms still precise despite centuries of 
age. As his tools found purchase in the ancient tumblers, the 
5 
f
 irst seal released with a whisper of stale air that carried scents 
of age and something else—something that made the torches 
f
 licker and die momentarily before roaring back to life with un
usual intensity. 
One by one, they worked through the seals. The elven 
lock required delicate manipulation of crystalline components 
that sang with faint harmonics when touched. The human 
mechanism responded to traditional techniques, though its in
ternal construction showed sophistication beyond contempo
rary engineering. The four unknown seals demanded careful 
experimentation, their alien geometries yielding only to persis
tence and intuition. 
With each breaking seal, the air grew colder and more 
oppressive. Strange whispers seemed to emanate from beyond 
the door, speaking in languages that predated current civiliza
tion. The words were incomprehensible, yet their meaning 
crept into the miners' minds like shadows: hunger, expansion, 
freedom, consumption.

Young Berin was the first to voice what they all felt. 
"Master Gorak, perhaps we should—" 
His words were cut off by thunder that seemed to origi
nate from within the mountain itself. The final seal gave way 
with a sound like breaking bones, and the massive door swung 
open with grinding inevitability. Beyond lay a chamber carved 
from the same black stone, but this space radiated wrongness 
that made their torches burn fitfully and their shadows behave 
independently of their movements. 
At the chamber's center yawned a circular pit with stairs 
carved into its walls, descending into darkness so absolute 
that their torchlight simply vanished into it without revealing 
depth or bottom. The whispers grew stronger, more insistent, 
and now they could distinguish multiple voices speaking in 
unison, their words carrying promises of power and threats of 
consequences in equal measure. 
"We should not be here," Korven said, his voice barely 
audible above the growing susurrus from below. "These seals 
7 
weren't placed by treasure hunters. They were put here by peo
ple who knew what they were doing." 
But as Gorak stepped closer to the pit's edge, young 
Berin lost his footing on stone made slick by condensation that 
had no natural source. His cry of surprise echoed down the 
stairwell as he tumbled into the darkness, his voice growing 
fainter with each impact until it cut off with abrupt finality. 
The silence that followed was worse than any scream. 
"Berin!" Korven called into the pit, but only whispers an
swered—whispers that now carried a note of satisfaction that 
made every man present step back from the opening. 
"We're leaving," Gorak commanded, his voice cracking 
with authority and fear. "Now. All of us." 
But as they turned to flee, their shadows lingered be
hind them, moving independently in the torchlight. By the time 
they reached the tunnel entrance, three more miners had 
simply vanished, leaving only their tools scattered on the stone 
8 
f
 loor and the echo of satisfied whispers following them toward 
the surface. 
Gorak survived to report the "accident" to the mine 
owners, speaking of a cave-in and tragic losses while carefully 
omitting any mention of seals, chambers, or whispers. He died 
three days later in his sleep, his final words recorded by his ter
rified wife: "The hunger in the dark. It's free now. It's so very 
hungry." 
The Shadowdepth Mines were officially closed due to 
unstable conditions, but the damage was already done. That 
very night, livestock in the surrounding valleys began behaving 
strangely, their eyes reflecting an intelligence that belonged to 
no natural beast. Plants withered without cause, and sensitive 
individuals reported dreams filled with whispers in languages 
they had never heard but somehow understood. 
Ancient warnings, carved in stone and sealed with the 
wisdom of seven peoples, had been ignored for the promise of 
silver. Now something that had been imprisoned for over a 
9 
millennium was free to remember its hunger and begin the 
slow work of feeding. 
The unsealing was complete. The spreading shadow 
had begun.
